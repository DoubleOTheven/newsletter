## ‚òïÔ∏è Technical updates

***In this edition, we‚Äôre experimenting with a new way to provide a digest of the latest updates to Substrate. If you have any feedback, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/newsletter/issues) ‚Äì we welcome your input.***

The updates highlighted below are PRs that have been merged into Substrate which contain the **B1-note_worthy** label and are likely relevant to most builders. Please have a look at the [full list of PRs on GitHub](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3AB1-note_worthy) to get more details on them and to go through others not included in this section.

**FRAME: Fix the Referenda confirming alarm #13704**

We were doing a straight `mul` to get the block number from a `Perbill`, which will round down if the fractional part is half or less. We should always be rounding up, though, to ensure that when the alarm goes off the confirmation period is definitely ready to begin.

**Assets pallet: Giving the asset owner the ability to set minimum balance #13486**

Introduces a new extrinsic `set_min_balance` which allows the owner of the specific asset to change the `min_balance` required for an asset.

**Metadata V15: Expose pallet documentation #13452**

This patch captures the pallet documentation declared on the pallet module.
The documentation added to this pallet is later on included in the runtime metadata.

**Add `defensive_assert!` macro #13423**

Similar to [`assert!`] but will print an error without `debug_assertions` instead of silently ignoring it. 

**Salary pallet #13378**

Introduce a new pallet and associated traits which allows a chain to configure autonomous payments to members of a ranked collective.

**Return account's asset balances #13352**

This method solves the problem of fetching the account's asset balances. Now, instead of sending 100+ RPC requests it would be possible to send just one.

**Pallet dispatchable+storage doc module. #13341**

The goal of this PR is to make docs for dispatchables and storages on pallets more accessible and discoverable when browsing the generated docs. The PR accomplishes this by adding two auto-generated modules to all pallets: dispatchables and `storage_types`. These modules are only produced when building docs and otherwise do not exist or interfere with pallets. The `storage_types` module is auto-populated with documented structs representing each storage type from the parent pallet. The dispatchables module is auto-populated with uncallable auto-generated functions matching the signature of each `Call` variant. Right now a link to the corresponding `Call` enum variant is also included, though this may be removed. A note is included specifying that these cannot be called and are doc-only.

**Metadata V15: Expose API to fetch metadata for version #13287**

This PR extends the Metadata API to fetch the metadata at a given provided version.

It lays the foundation for keeping the metadata V14 around and exposing the V15 for early adopters before making a major breaking change.

**[NFTs] Offchain mint #13158**

This PR adds a new way of minting NFTs with pre-signed data.

As the collection's owner, you can pre-sign a mint data and pass the signature to the end-user, who would submit it on-chain. The item's mint and metadata/attributes deposits will be taken from the end user.

In the mint data, it's possible to set the metadata and attributes for the item, set the deadline for signature and whitelist the origin.
