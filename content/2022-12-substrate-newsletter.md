# sub0 recap ‚è™ | Polkadot & Kusama Ecosystem Map Released üó∫Ô∏è

This year‚Äôs edition of sub0, the first edition back in-person since the pandemic, was a huge success. Hundreds of new and veteran developers from the Polkadot developer community came together to connect, collaborate, and learn from more than 55 speakers. Throughout the conference, this quote from Bertrand Russell kept coming to mind:

_‚ÄúThe only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.‚Äù_

While we wait for the recordings of the sub0 talks to be released, make sure to check out the recaps on Twitter ([Day 1](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1597317004905828352?utm_campaign=Parity%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=237189384&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--luRdFgQNmf9lHCQCftRJ4h-pXxtrT07wTNJ3Z3gLuoRqQ2aQpxUp5Pt6LltsgRPIrpDM46MfaK9USc-ThwrGdveRQMg&utm_content=237189384&utm_source=hs_email), [Day 2](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1597675261415526400?utm_campaign=Parity%20Newsletter&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=237189384&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_7q46TWNg02sVi685yuBV1FN01Ftq3RObQbZnE-MHjSvJHH2atuU677JyBZF9WsIyNvTrHlDGzxjqREBRn9JVl8rJo8Q&utm_content=237189384&utm_source=hs_email)) and YouTube ([Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MnrABFLxik&themeRefresh=1), [Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk6qix6Br_k)).

## üëÄ Releases

* [ink! 4.0-beta has been released](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases). It includes a stable ABI which will be used for ink! 4.0. Note that between now and the stable releases there will still be breaking code changes, but because of the stable ABI, deployed contracts will still be able to interact with each other. Start testing it and submit an issue if you encounter any problems! Read the [November ink! newsletter](https://use.ink/monthly-update/2022/11) for more updates
* New [node template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template) release, tagged to polkadot-v0.9.34
