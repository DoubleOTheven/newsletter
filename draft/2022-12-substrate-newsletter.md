## TL;DR and important announcements

## 🔦 Community highlights

Astar Network has introduced dApp [Staking Portal V2](https://medium.com/astar-network/our-dapp-staking-portal-v2-is-live-d4a1eba0563a), improving user experience to connect with parachain assets and encourage users to support developers through staking.  
 
* OpenZepplin will audit ink! and the Contract pallet. The ink! team and various Parachains are also working on a bounty proposal to kick off ink!ubator, a builder + auditor program to support companies building with ink! and to foster a Smart Contract auditing market. Part of the funding will also be used to develop open source audited smart contract templates and a React hooks library to make full stack development more ergonomic and fun. Join the conversation in the [ink! Element channel](https://matrix.to/#/!vvBpQdXROGzuQNhjEN:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io) and read the [November ink! newsletter](https://use.ink/monthly-update/2022/11) for more updates.

## 👀 Releases

* [ink! 4.0-beta released](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases). It includes a stable ABI which will be used for ink! 4.0. Note that between now and the stable releases there will still be breaking code changes, but because of the stable ABI deployed contracts will still be able to interact with each other. Start testing it and submit an issue if you encounter any problems!
