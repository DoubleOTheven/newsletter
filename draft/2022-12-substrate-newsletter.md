## 👀 Releases

* [ink! 4.0-beta released](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/releases). It includes a stable ABI which will be used for ink! 4.0. Note that between now and the stable releases there will still be breaking code changes, but because of the stable ABI deployed contracts will still be able to interact with each other. Start testing it and submit an issue if you encounter any problems!
