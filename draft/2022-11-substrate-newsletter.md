## 🔦 Community highlights



[Anagolay](https://anagolay.network/) has built a [Web3 API Auth Token (WAAT) library](https://github.com/kelp-hq/oss/tree/22f85a75887ddcf65fe411e008f9bc7ba2d3203f/tools/web3-api-auth-token) which allows the secure transmission of information between two parties using a base64Url encoded JSON object.

WAAT can be used for for authorization and informational exchange, learn more [here](https://github.com/kelp-hq/oss/tree/22f85a75887ddcf65fe411e008f9bc7ba2d3203f/tools/web3-api-auth-token#why-we-should-use-waat).
- Authorization: DApps can load the users' account from the wallet browser extension, use the keys to create the signature and then make the request to the API allowing users to access resources, services and routes that are permitted with that token.
- Information Exchange: Web3 API Auth Tokens are an excellent way to transmit information where the integrity needs to be checked and validated. Because WAATs can be signed, any party receiving them can verify the integrity and authenticity.
