To kick off this February edition, we'd like you to join us in celebrating the **5 year anniversary of Substrate‚Äôs beginnings**, from this very [PR #60](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/60), where Substrate started emerging out of what was initially the Polkadot codebase. Check it out yourself: a lot of renaming crates and separating primitives from being Polkadot-specific and non-Polkadot-specific. üéÇüß¨

**Polkadot Forum Digest**

In case you‚Äôve missed some of the discussions happening in the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/)**, **here are some highlights from recent announcements and discussions: 

* Core engineers at Parity are looking for a technical project manager to steward the future of FRAME. Ideally this person has already been a long term core contributor to FRAME and is keen on leading this as a community effort. Join the discussion in [this forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/ecosystem-wide-frame-project-manager/1856).
* Take a peek at the the latest resources for testing XCM shared in [this thread](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/best-resources-to-learn-xcm-tech-high-level/192) where Shawn shares an example for using the [XCM simulator](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/xcm/xcm-simulator)
* A new tool for maintaining and managing a local list of RPC Endpoints called `subrpc` is introduced in [this forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/subrpc-manage-multiple-endpoint-registries-and-quickly-find-endpoints/1748). This helps apps by no longer needing to provide a flag for each specific endpoint, but just specifying a flag for the chain you want to connect to, for example `your-cli --chain polkadot` and be sure to connect to a quality RPC endpoint.
* Learn about [the future of Polkadot‚Äôs staking system in this forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/the-future-of-polkadot-staking/1848) post detailing how the current system has evolved over time, and opening the discussion for implementing new features to it.

## ‚òïÔ∏è Technical updates

Most of the technical updates this month pertain to runtime developers and infrastructure and tooling services who may be affected by updates in the Substrate codebase. This include:


* The `AssetTxFeePaid `event from the Assets Pallet now displays the fee and tip in the actual asset ID that was used in that transaction. Previously, these were only displayed in the chain‚Äôs native token which made it confusing for users and tools reading the event. This was fixed by adding a conversion inside the pallet ( [#13083](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13083))
* The Scheduler Pallet‚Äôs code version has been bumped to V4 in [this patch](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13105). Chains who deployed a genesis without this patch should manually set the scheduler version to 4 and not use `v3::MigrateToV4`.
* The API for randomness has been deprecated in the Contracts Pallet ([#13204](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13204)). This avoids that chains that use this interface could provide insecure randomness and encourages chains that can provide secure randomness to expose this as a chain extension or via an oracle contract.
* In the Assets Pallet, the `Issued` event‚Äôs field `total_supply` has been renamed to `amount` to make it clearer that it returns the amount newly minted. Note that this is a breaking change for indexing services ([#13229](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13229)).
* The benchmarks macro has been updated to a proc macro, making them closer to how tests are written in Rust and more flexible for writing benchmarks for specific calls ([#12924](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12924)).
* A runtime's `WeightToFee` and `LengthToFee` impls are now available via runtime API, allowing client to a take an executed extrinsic from a block and validate each portion of its fees ([#13110](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13110)).
* A new function called `contains_prefix` has been added to FRAME‚Äôs storage API, allowing to check whether a `StorageDoubleMap` or `DoubleNMap` contains a specified key prefix ([#13232](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13232)). 
* The `PerDispatchClass` struct which returns the total weight consumed by all extrinsics in the block has been updated to follow usual arithmetic conventions. This includes renaming `add` to `accrue; checked_add` to `checked_accrue`; and `sub` to `reduce `([#13194](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13194)).
* `CountedMap::set `is now consistent with `StorageMap::set`, whereby it now delegates `CountedMap::insert` and `CountedMap::remove` to update the count on value removal or insertion ([#13214](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13214)). If you have used` CountedStorageMap::set`, you should call `initialize_counter` since otherwise the stored count and the actual number of elements will differ.

## üëÄ Releases

Go to [Polkadiff](https://polkadiff.parity.io/) for a full list of merged PRs into Substrate, Polkadot and Cumulus since the last Polkadot release and be sure to read the [Polkadot Release Analysis of v0.9.37](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-release-analysis-v0-9-37/1736) on the Polkadot forum. In this section, we go over updates from various core tools developed by Parity for the ecosystem. 

### **Subxt ([v0.26.0](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/releases/tag/v0.26.0)) üì´**

_A Rust library to submit extrinsics (transactions) to a Substrate node via RPC._

Notable changes include making the Storage API more block-centric and making Substrate dependencies optional.

### **Sidecar ([v14.3.1](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar/releases/tag/v14.3.1)) üöó**

_Sidecar is a REST service that makes it easy to interact with blockchain nodes built using Substrate's FRAME framework._

This update fixes a few bugs, including adding the use of the latest error metadata for `fetchErrorItem` and renaming nomination-pools to be to standard.

### **Tx-wrapper ([v5.0.0](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/releases/tag/v5.0.0)) üç¨**

_Tx-wrapper provides tools for FRAME chain builders to publish chain specific offline transaction generation libraries._

Major changes include removing `store_call` from `asMulti` as v9340 Polkadot runtimes will no longer support it.

### **Zombienet ([v1.3.33](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases/tag/v1.3.33)) üßü**

_Zombienet is a CLI tool to easily spawn ephemeral parachain networks and perform tests against them._

Only minor fixes and no breaking changes.
