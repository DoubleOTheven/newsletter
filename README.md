# üóû The Substrate Developer Newsletter

A place to facilitate content curation for the Substrate Developer Newsletter.

> _Note: this repository is WIP, inspired by how This Week in Rust is curated._
_Currently, the newsletter is written and published without much community involvement._
_It's author (@sacha-l) wishes to move towards a more participatory system that allows any developer in the Polkadot ecosystem to contribute to it._
_Please submit an issue with any questions, concerns or feedback._

The Substrate Developer Newsletter aims to provide updates for developers in the Polkadot builder ecosystem including:

* **Community highlights**: SDKs, tooling or new products or updates from the community.
 
* **Upcoming events**: in-person or online events, such as Meetups or Hackathons.
 
* **Technical updates**: notable updates in the Substrate and Polkadot codebases.

* **Releases**: notes on new Polkadot releases and tooling maintained by Parity.

## üì≠ PRs for next issue are now being accepted

To propose content for inclusion in the next newsletter (found in the `drafts/` folder), create a new Pull Request updating the relevant section in the draft.

Alternately, tweet us @substrate_io.

### ‚úÖ What do we look for when considering whether to include something in the Substrate Developer Newsletter?

* Community highlights including new pallets, SDKs, or features that could be interesting for other developers to learn about
* Upcoming events relevant to the Polkadot developer community
* Mentions of PRs that are worthy of being included in the "Technical Updates" section

### ‚ùå What we are generally NOT looking for

* Promoting a particular project without any relevance for developers
* Promoting a specific job opening (we link out to a separate site for this anyways)
* Anything degrading to another community or existing community member
